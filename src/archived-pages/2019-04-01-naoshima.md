In the Seto Inland Sea, there are remote islands filled with art installations
and museums. Contemporary art has gained prominence in the region due to the
Setouchi Triennale (also known as the Setouchi International Art Festival) is an
art festival held every three years.
Like many rural parts of Japan, the islands in the Seto Inland Sea have been suffering from massive depopulation in recent decades, while their remaining residents have been aging at a rapid pace, causing a wide range of problems. One of the festival's main goals is to counteract these trends and revitalize the region in a sustainable and creative way by bringing contemporary art and tourism onto the islands.

## Teshima

The main attraction on Teshima is the Teshima Art Museum. Called a 'museum' it's
actually the artwork itself. Standing amongst terraced rice fields, the simple concrete structure stimulates its visitors' senses with the play of water drops on a concrete surface.

Much of Naoshima's art was installed by the Benesse Corporation, which oversees art museums, installations and sculptures both on Naoshima and on neighboring islands. Benesse's museums were designed by the well known Japanese architect Ando Tadao
