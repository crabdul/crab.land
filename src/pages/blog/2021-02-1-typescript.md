So the requirements are clear on a feature you need to build and you're about to start working on it.

This is the perfect opportunity to document and share your plan for how you'll be tackling the problem.

One option is to 30 minutes 'kick-off' meeting with the person who is most likely to review your work.



You really should be able to another developer how you aim to implement the feature. The other developer may have some suggestions to go about the problem. 

This is also great for imparting context to the other developer.

Code reviews are not just technical reviews. A good review should cover domain knowledge. This is difficult to do if you have little context about the problem space, a common occurence if the reviewer doesn't normally work in this problem space.

Don't overwhelm your colleagues at once.

Ultimately, communicate early. Discover issues early.
