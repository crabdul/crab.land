The Shimanami Kaido (しまなみ海道, Shimanami Kaidō) is a 60 kilometer long toll
road that connects Japan's main island of Honshu to the island of <a
href="https://www.japan-guide.com/list/e1107.html" target="_blank">Shikoku</a>,
passing over six small islands in the Seto Inland Sea. It is also known as the
Nishiseto Expressway. It starts in Onomichi, a hilly port town known for its
temple walks as well as its literary and movie contributions (It's the setting
for <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046438/" target="_blank">Tokyo
Story</a>)

I only cycled halfway due to lack of time. Here are some photos.
