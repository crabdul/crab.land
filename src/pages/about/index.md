**a place to write about mostly programming related things**

Things I'm into right now (Subject to Change):

- Using [**TypeScript**](https://img.ifunny.co/images/c83197b2c08dd00874daac4fb3b536f998037ee264254b91298558ff652687dc_1.jpg) and realising how dreadful and error prone all previous code I'd written was
- Using [**XState**](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate) and realising how dreadful and error prone all previous code I'd written was. Take all your business logic out of React!
- Using [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/) so I don't have to write any CSS, SCSS or styled-components anymore
- Always on the hunt for new Vim tricks or config to add to my [.vimrc](https://github.com/dotfiles)
